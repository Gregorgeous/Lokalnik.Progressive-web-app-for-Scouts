# "Lokalnik": OnsenUi-Vue.js-PWA

NB. this branch uses OnsenUI instead of Vuetify for UI components BUT is OUTDATED (started project with Onsen, switched to Vuetify as it has more components and between-pages navigation is worked out more intuitively)

First progressive web app for learning purposes 
App's main purpose: create helpful tools for Warsaw-Zoliborz Scout District to manage their HQ (organizing events happening there weekly, lookin up who's having keys to the place, etc.)
